# Population Growth BD

This project analyzes the population growth of Bangladesh from 1971 to 2016. It uses historical data to explore trends in total population, gender ratios, population growth rates, and makes predictions for future population growth. The project utilizes Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to analyze and visualize the data.

## Project Overview

This project examines the historical population growth of Bangladesh and provides insights into trends, growth rates, and gender population ratios over the years. Additionally, the project forecasts future population growth for both males and females from 2017 to 2030 using linear regression.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Bangladesh Population Growth Ratio Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salmaneunus/bangladesh-population-growth-ratio).

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning (for linear regression)
- `numpy`: Numerical operations

## Data Analysis

### Total Population Trend
A line plot is created to visualize the total population of Bangladesh from 1971 to 2016.

### Male-to-Female Ratio
The male-to-female ratio is calculated and visualized over the years to observe the gender balance.

### Population Growth Rate
The annual growth rate of the total population is calculated and visualized.

### Male vs Female Growth Rate
Separate growth rates for male and female populations are calculated and compared visually.

### Highest and Lowest Growth
The years with the highest and lowest population growth rates between two consecutive years are identified.

## Prediction

Using linear regression, future male and female populations for the years 2017 to 2030 are predicted based on historical data.
