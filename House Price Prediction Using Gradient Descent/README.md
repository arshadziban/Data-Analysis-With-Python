# Synthetic House Price Prediction Dataset for Gradient Descent Practice

## Dataset Overview

This dataset is designed for practicing Gradient Descent. It contains 500 samples of house-related data, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, house age, and the corresponding house price. The target variable (House_Price) is generated using a linear equation with added noise to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Features Description

- **Square_Feet**: The size of the house in square feet (ranging from 500 to 5000).
- **Num_Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the house (ranging from 1 to 5).
- **House_Age**: The age of the house in years (ranging from 1 to 100).
- **House_Price**: The predicted house price (target variable), calculated based on a linear formula with added noise.
